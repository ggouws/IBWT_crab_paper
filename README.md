# IBWT_crab_paper
Data and metadata from a publication in which DNA sequence data and microsatellite genotype data were used to examine whether Inter-Basin Water Transfer schemes facilitate the migration of freshwater crabs among catchments in the Eastern Cape, South Africa.

DNA sequence data from the 16S large subunit rRNA and cytochrome oxidase _c_ subunit I (COI) mitochondrial fragments have been lodged in NCBI GenBank and are available under accession numbers PV460970 - PV461024, and PV433402 - PV433474, respectively.

The microsatellite genotype data available here were obtained from the following loci: Pp 1, Pp3, Pp4 and, Pp5 (trinucleotide repeat motifs), and Pp6, Pp7, Pp8 and Pp9 (dinucleotide repeats).

Microsatellite data <br>
<br>
_Interbasin_crab_genotypes.xlsx_ contains the microsatellite genotype data and other information in the following fields and arrangement. <br>
<br>
Samples are in rows, with loci and metadata in columns. Each locus (diploid) is presented over two columns, with a sized (amplicon fragment size) and called allele in each. Missing data/alleles are indicated by zero (_0_). <br>
<br>



Sample metadata <br>
<br>
_Sample_metadata.xlsx_ contains the following information and fields: <br>
<br>
__Sample/Isolate__: The DNA extraction number and sample number by which the sample is referred to in the analyses. <br>
<br>
__Tissue sample number__ : Tissue sample from wich DNA was isolated. Tissue samples are lodged in the Biomaterials Collection of the National Research Foundation - South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity <br>
<br>
__Locality__: Collection/sampling locality of each sample. <br>
__Population__: Population sample to which sample was allocated for the analyses. <br>
<br>
__Longitude__: Longitude of the sampling locality. <br>
<br>
__Latitude__: Latitude of the sampling locality. <br>
<br>
__Date__: Date of sampling. <br>
<br>
__16S GenBank accession__: NCBI GenBank accession number for the 16S large subunit rRNA mtDNA sequence derived from the sample. <br>
<br>
__COI GenBank accession__: NCBI GenBank accession number for the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) mtDNA sequence derived from the sample. <br>
<br>
__Microsatellite genotypes__: Logical operator (TRUE or FALSE) as to whether the individual sample was genotyped at the eight microsatellite loci. <br>
