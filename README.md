# IBWT_crab_paper
Data and metadata from a publication in which DNA sequence data and microsatellite genotype data were used to examine whether Inter-Basin Water Transfer schemes facilitate the migration of freshwater crabs among catchments in the Eastern Cape, South Africa.

DNA sequence data from the 16S large subunit rRNA and cytochrome oxidase _c_ subunit I (COI) mitochondrial fragments have been lodged in NCBI GenBank and are available under accession numbers PV460970 - PV461024, and PV433402 - PV433474, respectively.

The microsatellite genotype data available here were obtained from the following loci: Pp 1, Pp3, Pp4 and, Pp5 (trinucleotide repeat motifs), and Pp6, Pp7, Pp8 and Pp9 (dinucleotide repeats).

Sample metadata
Sample_metadata.xlsx contains the following information and fields:
Sample/Isolate : The DNA extraction number and sample number by which the sample is referred to in the analyses.
Tissue sample number : Tissue sample from wich DNA was isolated. Tissue samples are lodged in the Biomaterials Collection of the National Research Foundation - South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity 
Locality: Collection/sampling locality of each sample.
Population: Population sample to which sample was allocated for the analyses.
Longitude: Longitude of the sampling locality.
Latitude: Latitude of the sampling locality.
Date: Date of sampling.
16S GenBank accession: NCBI GenBank accession number of the 16S large subunit rRNA mtDNA sequence derived from the sample.
COI GenBank accession NCBI GenBank accession number of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) mtDNA sequence derived from the sample.
Microsatellite genotypes: Logical operator (TRUE or FALSE) as to whether the individual sample was genotyped at the eight microsatellite loci.
