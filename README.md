# IBWT_crab_paper
Data and metadata from a publication in which DNA sequence data and microsatellite genotype data were used to examine whether Inter-Basin Water Transfer schemes facilitate the migration of freshwater crabs among catchments in the Eastern Cape, South Africa.

DNA sequence data from the 16S large subunit rRNA and cytochrome oxidase _c_ subunit I (COI) mitochondrial fragments have been lodged in NCBI GenBank and are available under accession numbers PV460970 - PV461024, and PV433402 - PV433474, respectively.

The microsatellite genotype data available here were obtained from the following loci: Pp 1, Pp3, Pp4 and, Pp5 (trinucleotide repeat motifs), and Pp6, Pp7, Pp8 and Pp9 (dinucleotide repeats).
